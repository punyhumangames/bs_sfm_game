Masks
Most characters don't have correct faces. The faces were never meant to be shown (hi Pyro), so it'd be best if you can mask our characters using the supplied masks, under the masks folder.

Phalanx Mask
There is currently an export issue with default_phalanx mask. It's rotated, and slightly offset.
